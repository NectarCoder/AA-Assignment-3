## Run Program

Ensure Python 3.12 or higher is installed.  

Open a terminal window and change directories to this project. `main.py` is the main Levenshtein script. Enter the following command:  
`python .\main.py`  

Input file under the `InputsOutputs` folder will be used to find the Levenshtein differences.  
Output for the inputs will be displayed in the console, and also saved to the `InputsOutputs` folder as `Output.txt`.

To run the test cases, run the following command:
`python .\tests.py`
